<H2>My top Movies of all-time</H2> <br/>
<Hr/>
<H3>The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</H3> 
<p>I'm just going to include the whole trilogy rather than list them right beside each other, the movies all include so much passion from the director, actors and other members of the production. The cinematography, acting, story and music all blend together so well and create such a beautiful and epic story.</p>

<H3>Shrek</H3> 
<P>Shrek was one of the first movies I actually remember watching. I believe Shrek is a movie that can still be watched and enjoyed by families now as all of its qualities have aged pretty well, the animation is very good considering it was released very early in the 2000s, there is humor for both a younger and older audience and overall the story is sweet on both Shrek and Fionas part and it spawned some nice sequels.</P>

<H3>Requiem for a Dream</H3> 
<P>Overall, Requiem for a Dream is a very depressing movie and its not one I really ever "want" to watch. The movie is however one of the best representations of how drugs can ruin someones life. I love the movie for the fact that it is very real and unforgiving with its showing of how desperate and broken drug addiction will make people.</P>

<H3>Django</H3> 
<p>Django is a pretty brutal movie as Quentin Tarintino is pretty notorious for making bloody and violent movies but he does often create some really interesting and gripping plots. I think Django is his best movie as it focuses on a man just trying to save his wife in a cruel world that he just finally got a little bit of control in.</p>
